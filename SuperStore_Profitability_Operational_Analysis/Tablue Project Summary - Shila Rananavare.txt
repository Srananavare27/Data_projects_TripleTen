Project Summary
Overview
The analysis reveals key insights into the profitability, loss, and performance metrics of various products and subcategories across different regions and states. 
The following summary highlights the critical findings and recommendations for optimizing the storeâ€™s strategy.

Profit and Loss Analysis

Top Profit Makers:
Copiers in the West: $35,293
Chairs in the East: $22,827

Top Loss Makers:
Binders in Central: -$20,585
Tables in the East: -$12,073

Recommendation: Focus on expanding the copiers in the West due to their substantial profitability. 
Reevaluate the binders in Central, potentially discontinuing or reworking the strategy to mitigate losses.

Product Discontinuation

GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System: -$20,388
Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print: -$8,880
Bush Advantage Collection Racetrack Conference Table: -$5,192

Recommendation: Discontinue these high-loss products to reduce financial strain and reallocate resources to more profitable areas.

Subcategory Performance

Most Profitable Subcategories:
Copiers: $76,304
Phones: $56,053
Accessories: $49,993

Least Profitable Subcategories:
Tables: -$23,067
Bookcases: -$3,655
Supplies: -$923

Recommendation: Focus on promoting copiers, phones, and accessories. Consider discontinuing tables, bookcases, and supplies due to their negative profitability.

Advertising Strategy

Best Combinations of States and Months for Advertising:
Indiana: October, June, December
Rhode Island: December, October, September
Vermont: November, April, January

Recommendation: Allocate advertising budget effectively in these states and months to align with the optimal advertising spending strategy, 
which should be approximately 1/5 of the profit.

Return Rates

Products with High Return Rates:
Bush Saratoga Collection 5-Shelf Bookcase, Hanover Cherry: 100%
Global Leather Task Chair, Black: 54.05%

Customers with High Return Rates:
Roland Murray: 50%
Barry Franz: 37.88%

Recommendation: Investigate the high return rates for both products and customers. For the Copiers sub-category, despite high average profits ($908.4), 
the 25% return rate necessitates a thorough review to implement measures aimed at reducing returns and improving customer satisfaction.

Conclusion

By addressing the highlighted areas of concern, focusing on high-performing products and subcategories, optimizing advertising strategies, and managing return rates, 
the store can enhance profitability and operational efficiency. Implementing these recommendations will contribute to a more robust and financially sustainable business model.
